# Maintenance Task-to-Manual Matcher

A high-performance data processing pipeline that extracts maintenance tasks from structured task definitions and intelligently matches them with the corresponding technical manuals (PDFs). This system includes fuzzy matching and page-level indexing, making it ideal for automating document processing in industrial and maintenance environments.

## Overview

The **Maintenance Task-to-Manual Matcher** is designed to automate the process of associating maintenance tasks (extracted from task definition spreadsheets) with the corresponding sections in technical manuals (provided as PDFs). The system uses:

- **Optimized data loading**: Fast CSV import with vectorized operations.
- **Parallel PDF text extraction**: Uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` for concurrent extraction of text from PDFs.
- **Advanced text matching**: Combines exact matching (via regex) with fuzzy matching (using RapidFuzz or difflib).
- **Detailed output**: Exports a consolidated report with task details, matched manuals, and page references.

## Features

- **CSV Data Loading & Normalization**
  - Reads document metadata and task definitions.
  - Normalizes file paths and filters manuals based on document type.

- **Optimized PDF Text Extraction**
  - Extracts text from PDFs using both `pdfplumber` and `pypdf`.
  - Precomputes full text with page-level indexing for later matching.

- **Task Extraction and Cleaning**
  - Splits and cleans task definitions using precompiled regex patterns.
  - Handles both numbered tasks (e.g., `1. Replace filter`) and unnumbered tasks.

- **Manual-to-Task Matching**
  - Uses a combination of exact regex matching (with caching) and fuzzy matching.
  - Matches tasks to manuals and determines relevant page numbers.

- **Concurrency for Performance**
  - Utilizes `ThreadPoolExecutor` and `ProcessPoolExecutor` for parallel processing.
  - Designed to scale with large datasets and multiple documents.

- **Export Capabilities**
  - Outputs results in CSV and Excel formats with complete task and manual references.
